This project is an in-progress capstone project for my second concurrent degree, a BA in Music. I combine my passion for music and technology by developing a practical app that will be pivotal in improving the intonation ability of instrumentalists. The app will allow musicians to hear whether a pitch is out-of-tune by playing with professional recorded audio. The ability to adjust pitch in real time is critical to high-level ensembles and live performances.
